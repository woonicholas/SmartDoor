# SmartDoor
With the emergence of Edge Computing in IoT, SmartDoor is a proof of concept project of an automated attendance tracker that also serves as a more personalized security system. 

Security systems today tend to be bland and even undesirable with its outdated control systems and lack of customization. With SmartDoor, there is a personalized element for each employee in the form of a theme song. As employees enter and leave the building, a welcome message will play along with their theme song. At the same time, new data is sent up to the cloud so that data can be recorded and used for predictions in the future. Managers and employees alike will be able to track the history of when employees came into the office as well as prediction for when they might come in throughout the week on the user interface. With this edge system, entering the building will make anyone feel grandiose.
